<text> mutton biryani became popular after Wajid Ali Shah. In the year 1856, Wajid Ali Shah, the 10th and last Nawab of Awadh, after having dethroned was exiled from Lucknow to the city of Kolkata by the British. He brought his cooks with himself and that is how biryani was introduced to Kolkata.<br><br>According to historic records, biryani has its origins in the kitchens of Mughals and is a combination of the Persian pilaf and also inspired by some Indian spicy rice dishes. Another interesting story tells us that when Mumtaz Mahal, wife of Shah Jahan saw that the army barracks were undernourished she ordered the cooks to prepare a nutritious balanced dish for them and hence, biryani was made.
